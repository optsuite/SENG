# The Implementation of SENG

This is an implementation of the sketchy natural gradient method **SENG**. 

In this repository, we offer MindSpore and Pytorch codes of SENG in two subfolders, respectively. The codes are organized as follows:

```Current-Folder
    ├── MindSpore    : Url of MindSpore Implementation on ImageNet-1k with ResNet50. 
    |                  See README in the subfolder for more details.  
    └── PyTorch
          ├──cifar10 : PyTorch Implementation on CIFAR10 with ResNet18 and VGG16(_BN). 
          |            See README in the subfolder for more details.
          └──imagenet: PyTorch Implementation on ImageNet-1k with ResNet50. 
                       See README in the subfolder for more details.
```
